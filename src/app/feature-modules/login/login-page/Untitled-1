Pipes:
 - Transform data before display
 - Built in pipes include lowercase, uppercase, decimal, date, 
    percentage, currency etc
 - To apply a pipe on a interpolation property use the 
    pipe character | 
 - We can also chain pipe using colon : and also pass parameter
   <h1> {{employee.dob | date: 'fullDate'}} </h1>
   <h1> {{employee.salary | currency: 'USD':true }} </h1>
 - We can also create custom pipes
